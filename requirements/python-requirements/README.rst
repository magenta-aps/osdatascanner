For each of the OSÂ²datascanner components (**engine**, **admin**, **report**), a
``requirements-<component>.txt`` file is generated using ``pip-tools`` and ``.in``-files.
The ``.in``-files used by ``pip-tools`` are organized according to the "inheritance"
tree below, and each ``.in``-file includes all packages from its "parent file":

::
                                                  ------- api
                                                /
              ------------------------- engine -
            /
    common -                    ------- admin
            \                 /
              ------- django -
                              \
                                ------- report

                                        test

                                        lint


The requirements for the two Django components (**admin** and **report**) are
restricted by the versions required by the **engine**-component due to code
imports.

Furthermore, requirements for testing and linting are to be used by all three
components; both ``test`` and ``lint`` requirements are constrained by
(but does not include!) the versions from the ``engine``, ``admin``, and ``report``
``.txt``-files, while ``lint`` requirements are **additionally** constrained by
the versions required by ``test``.

To (re)generate the necessary ``requirements-*.txt``-files during development,
a ``Dockerfile`` and ``docker-compose.yml`` have been provided in the
``../../dev-environment/``-folder.

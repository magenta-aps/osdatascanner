class RulePrecedence(Enum):
    """
    Definitions for precedence for a rule.
    This is similar to associativity in programming language theory,
    but here we are dealing with operands instead of operators.

    Let's say that for some rules 'r1' and 'r2', we want to create a third
    rule 'r3 = r1 (or) r2'. We have to take into account that
    the compound-rule implements short-circuiting for efficiency
    reasons, so it would make sense to evaluate the 'cheapest' rule
    first. Let's say that 'r2' is cheaper in this case. To express that,
    we could say that 'r2' has left-precedence, so when making 'r3 = r1 (or) r2',
    we can check that 'r2' is left of 'r1', i.e. enforce an invariant.
    If the invariant is violated, then we can either raise an error or
    reorder based on operand-precedence so we get 'r3 = r2 (or) r1' instead and
    thus restore the invariant, depending on what is appropriate for the given
    situation.

    - 'UNDEFINED':
      'UNDEFINED' is the neutral element of precedence.

    - 'LEFT':
      'LEFT' means that a rule must be composed to the left of
      all rules that don't have left-precedence.

    - 'RIGHT':
      'RIGHT' means that a rule must be composed to the right of
      all rules that don't have right-precedence.

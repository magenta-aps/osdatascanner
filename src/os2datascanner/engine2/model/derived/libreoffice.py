"""Helper functions for converting Office documents

The document is converted to html using libreoffice. If some of the resulting html
files are larger than @size_treshold, specified in the config file under
[model.libreoffice], the html is replaced with a simpler representation.

Later, the html is converted to the representation needed by the rule thats is being
applied. This is done by the more generic convertes found in the
src/engine2/conversions folder

# "9" means "separate fields with U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION", "34" means "wrap
# string values in U+0022 QUOTATION MARK", and "76" means UTF-8 output
# The fields are described here
# https://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/DevGuide/Spreadsheets/Filter_Options#Filter_Options_for_the_CSV_Filter
# The filter name is found by looking at "oor:name" inside the relevant .xcu file

    persistent state use a SourceManager to keep track of that state.

    When used as a context manager, a SourceManager will automatically clean up
    all of the state that it's been tracking at context exit time. This might
    mean, for example, automatically disconnecting from remote resources,
    unmounting drives, or closing file handles.

    SourceManagers have an optional property called their "width", which is the
    number of open sub-Sources that can be below a Source at any given time.
    For example, a SourceManager with a width of 3 can have three open
    connections, each of which can have three open files, each of which can
    have three open pages, and so on. When opening a new Source would cause
    the width to be exceeded, the least-recently-used Source at that level will
    be closed. (Opening an already-open Source marks it as the most recently
    used one.)

/*** HOW TO USE ***/
/*
  - Mixins are reusable layout shortcuts.
  - Use them when the same layout pattern appears in multiple places.
  - If styling is one-off or component-specific, keep it local instead.

  BASIC USAGE:
    @include mixin-name;
    @include mixin-name(argument);

  USING @content:
    Some mixins accept an optional content block.
    Anything inside the { ... } is injected at the @content position
    inside the mixin.

    Example:
      @include layout-horizontal(0.5rem) {
        justify-content: space-between;
      }

    This applies the base layout, then adds/overrides rules locally.

  IMPORTANT:
    - Base layout rules come first; @content is applied after them.
    - Use @content for small layout tweaks, not full component styling.
    - "Nuclear" mixins (e.g. spacing-reset) are DEV-ONLY and should be
      used with care.

/*** LAYOUT MIXINS ***/

@mixin layout-vertical($gap: null) {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;

  @if $gap {
    gap: $gap;
  }

  @if content-exists() {
    @content;
  }

  /* NOTES */
  // Instant vertical flex layout without any fuss.
  // Applies a gap between elements if given any when included.
  // The "@content" tag makes it possible to apply extra context-relevant styles if needed (e.g. "justify-content: center;").
}

@mixin layout-horizontal($gap: null) {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  align-items: center;

  @if $gap {
    gap: $gap;
  }

  @if content-exists() {
    @content;
  }

  /* NOTES */
  // Instant horizontal flex layout without any fuss.
  // Items are center-aligned by default. (Can be overwritten if needed).
  // Applies a gap between elements if given any when included.
  // The "@content" tag makes it possible to apply extra context-relevant styles if needed (e.g. "justify-content: space-between;").
}

@mixin flex-center {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;

  @if content-exists() {
    @content;
  }

  /* NOTES */
  // Centers content of a given container both horizontally and vertically.
  // Works without fuss 98.5% of the time — as long as the container has a height (or content defines it).
}

/*** DEV-ONLY MIXINS ***/

@mixin spacing-reset {
  * {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
  }

  /* NOTES */
  // DEV-ONLY: Nukes margin/padding on *all descendants* for full control over layout.
  // If you use this, include it at the top (before any other styling for that element) — otherwise you risk wiping out your own margin/padding styles.
  // Avoid keeping it in production unless you're fully comfortable with the potential consequences.

Hello

For your information, your OSdatascanner-scan @ {{ scanner_name }} was not able to run.

This is because of the validation status of the job. Someone without validation permission has likely made changes to this scanner.

Access the scanner page to see more:

    {{ scanner_edit_url }}

Kind regards,

## 3.20.6, 2nd October 2023

"Purple Orchid in my Windowsill"

### New in this release

- A new simple diagnostics tool, which can be called as a management command.

  - Gives basic information about objects in the database.

  - Separate commands for the admin and report module.

  - Using the command in the report module gives information about the
    following objects: Account, Alias, OrganizationalUnit, Organization,
    DocumentReport, and problem messages on DocumentReports.

  - Using the command in the admin module gives information about the
    following objects: Account, Alias, OrganizationalUnit, Organization,
    UserErrorLog, and Rule.
    
- From this point on, it is only allowed to select one rule per scanner job.
  If one wishes to use combinations of rules, the rule builder should
  be used to create a new rule from existing ones.
    
- Added support in the report module for deleting Office 365 emails belonging to logged-in user. 

- A new replacement for the Health Rule has been added.
  This rule is simpler and promises far greater scanning speeds.

### General improvements

- Users will now only ever be able to see data from their own organization
  when accessing the DPO overview.

- The UserErrorLogView is now hidden by default. This can be toggled by a
  configuration.

- The scan status tab in the admin module now issues no duplicate queries to
  the database, and prefetches related scanners.
  
- Performance has been improved in the report module.

  - The number of queries has been greatly reduced, and is now constant
    regardless of the number of results.

  - An index has been created on the "only_notify_superadmin"-field on the
    DocumentReport model.
    
- The OrganizationalUnit overview is now considerably faster.

- The user manual for the report module, has been updated to match the current
  version of the system
  
### Bugfixes

- Scannerjobs for Exchangescanner won't start until validation is confirmed

  the ScanStatus and Scanner relations are prefetched.
  
- The mini-scanner now enforces server-side validation of the file size restriction.

- Workers no longer freeze during status message preparation if the object's
  metadata is not available.

- Re-examining a spreadsheet scanned with version 3.20.4 or older of
  OS2datascanner will no longer fail with an unsupported format error.

- Matches found in an Exchange mail account that is later deleted will now be
  correctly treated as though they had been deleted.

## 3.20.5, 11th September 2023

"Mo' Code Less Problems"

### New in this release

- Functionality for manually cleaning up stale accounts in the admin module.

  - Scanners with stale accounts now display a warning in the UI.

  - Users in the admin module can choose which stale accounts to clean up
    reports for, and which to leave as is.

- Access to the DPO-overview in the report module is now based on Position-
  objects with the "data protection officer"-role, instead of the DPO Role-
  object, which has been removed.

- Excel and Spreadsheet-like files will now be processed with pandas.DataFrame
  and present a match with a precise location including sheet and row.
  
### General improvements

- The pipeline will stop execution of a rule component after it has produced
  (by default) ten matches, reducing the memory usage and total message size
  and improving performance.

- Scheduled execution of scans should be more robust, both in the user
  interface and in the backend service (and, if the latter goes wrong in some
  way, it can now print informative debugging information).

### Bugfixes

- Result collector is now more robust if encountering identical problem messages.

- The estimated time of completion of scannerjobs no longer breaks, if the
  ScanStatus only has one snapshot.

- Adjusted shadow effect for visualizing scrollability on tables in the admin 
  module, ensuring compatibility with Safari browsers.

- Undistributed reports from the same scannerjob with differing scan_times
  will no longer cause multiple instances of the same scannerjob in the
  overview of undistributed scannerjobs in the report module.

- Web scans now use heuristics to detect files that have been deleted but which
  do not produce a `4xx` error code.

  - Suggestions for further heuristics to add are welcome; this function is new
    and by no means complete.

## 3.20.4, 16th August 2023

"To Prevent Arthritis"

### New in this release

- It is now possible to scan files shared through Microsoft Teams. 

- Removed expressions, "generelt" and "diverse", from HealthRule.

- The Pipeline has received an overhaul with respect to the use of RabbitMQ,
  such that workers can be assigned to serve a dedicated organisation.
  Thus, for a system we multiple workers and organisations, it is possible
  to run multiple scanner jobs in parallel.

  refactored, and is more robust towards missing created_timestamp-values on
  related DocumentReports.

- Logging in with SSO now works with more than one organization in the database,
  as long as the user's account already exists.

- Ordering by match count in the leader overview now reevaluates match counts 
  for all accounts, without having to scroll to the bottom of the page first.

## 3.20.3, 3rd August 2023

### General improvements

- Temporary errors produced when checking a match again are now displayed as a
  warning in the report module.
  
- The `start_scan` management command has a new convenience parameter for
  starting (partial or complete) scans that do not enforce the last
  modification date check.

- The manual in the admin module is now hidden by default. The visibility of
  this page can be configured in the pillar settings.

### Bugfixes

  statuses that have become stuck due to a small number of missing status
  messages.

- Scan statuses can no longer disappear from the list of completed scans by
  reporting themselves to be more than 100% complete.

- Manually created Position objects for users in units they are already members of, can now
  coexist with imported ones.

- Initial support for caching:

  - OS2datascanner can now maintain a disk cache of the results of its
    conversion operations.

  - Converted forms can be retrieved from the cache almost instantaneously,
    making it much easier to iteratively test and improve rules.

  - Cached representations are compressed and encrypted: a 13 megabyte PDF
    file with many embedded images, for example, uses approximately 50
    kilobytes of cache space.

- Support for filtering by organizational units in the DPO overview.

- Support for automatically refreshing expired OS2mo access tokens.

### General improvements

- Considerable perfomance improvement in the DPO-overview (about 90% faster 
  database interaction).

  tooltip.

## Version 3.20.1, 22nd June 2023

"Artificial CEO"

### New in this release

- It is now possible to view and sort reports by the age of the scanned resource. When the screen is wide, it remains a caret, but on smaller screens (i.e. smartscreens) the sort options becomes two buttons at the top of the page. 

- Support for simple scans in the administration system:

  - It is now possible to upload individual files to the administration
    system and to view the results of executing a rule on them.

  - This feature is useful for rapidly prototyping rules prior to running a
    full-scale scan.
    
- The "Archive"-tab returns!

  - This tab has three sub-tabs for personal, remediator and undistributed
    results.

### General improvements

  user error log objects in the usr interface. Matched substrings are also
  highlighted for ease of reading.
  
- Error logs can now be sorted by name, start time and path.

- Users can now create "rulesets" instead of regex rules in the "Rules"-tab
  in the admin module.

  - Rulesets are a more flexible way of combining rules, allowing for AND, OR
    and NOT operators between them.

  - This change allows combining preexisting rules and custom regex rules,
    for example, it is now possible to create a rule that matches a file if it
    contains both a CPR number *and* a name.

### General improvements

  its complexity and responsibilities.

- "Account" now has a manager-class, responsible for corresponding User objects.

- The pie chart showing distribution of sensitivities has been removed from the
  DPO overview.

#### Bugfixes

- No longer are DocumentReports created for missing objects of no relevance.

## Version 3.19.2, 21st April 2023

"Hairstylist of the Year"

### New in this release

  - Traditional file scans now have a flag that indicates that the folder to be
    scanned is the parent of users' home folders.

  - When this flag is set, the owner of a home folder is given responsibility
    for everything in it, even files that they do not technically own.

- On top of the already-existing organisational unit manager role, Accounts can
  now declare that a specific person is their line manager. (This information
  is presently only available when importing data from Microsoft Graph.)

- The next scheduled scanjob of a scanner is now shown on the "scanners"-page in the admin-module.

- In the report module a superuser can search for a scan job to distribute if there is more 
  than 10 undistributed scanner jobs.
  
- In the report module a superuser can search for a scan job to distribute.

  reports associated with a given account and scanner job from the admin 
  module.

- It is now possible to configure the admin module to automatically initiate a
  cleanup of DocumentReport-objects in the report module after each succesful
  import job.

- Experimental support for extra hints in web scans:

  - OS2datascanner can now extract `<title />`s from web pages and can use
    these when presenting matches.

  - Websites can now indicate that their links correspond to some other URL.
    When this is used, the report module will display that other URL instead.
    (This provides a better experience when using a proxy server to scan an
    external system's content.)

### General improvements

- The documentation for the web scanner has been greatly expanded.

- It is now possible to hide the archive-tab through a configuration variable.

- Sizes of the widgets in the DPO statistics overview fit their content better.

    available in the administration system.

  - The administration system now also includes a new rule for Danish-language
    medical terminology. (This rule uses a mechanically-generated data set and
    so may produce false positives.)

- A refreshed user interface:

  - A new user interface has been introduced in the report module.

  - The design of both the administration system and the report module has been
    made responsive.

### General improvements

## Version 3.11.7, 4th October 2021

"To kill a Mockingbird"

### New in this version

- The Webscanner is now agnostic about a set of common subdomains:

  - When specifying the url of a site, it is no longer important to specify
    e.g. a `www` subdomain. The list of common subdomains that are treated as
    equal are `"www", "www2", "m", "ww1", "ww2", "en", "da", "secure"`

- Support for canceling a scan:

  - The queue system was recently changed to be persistent, meaning that no
    messages were lost if OS2datascanner was updated or restarted. As a
    side-effect it was impossible to cancel a running scan. This release makes
    it possible again to stop a running scan.
    Note: This is *initial* support and not hooked up to the user interface
    yet.

### General improvements

- The `CPRRule` is updated with a list prefix-words that indicates a false
  match:

  - The list of prefixes is updated using feedback from users. If any of the
    `prefix` words are found in the content and there is a match, the `CPRRule`
    discard the match as false positive.
    The list of prefixes are found in `src/os2datascanner/engine2/rules/cpr.py`

- Metrics are now collected from the admin- and report Django applications:

  - The metrics are sent to prometheus and includes `requests latency`,
    `number of requests` and related performance numbers. No user specific
    information is collected.
    The collected metrics can be seen with on port `5001` from within the
    container, e.g. `docker-compose exec report bash -c "curl localhost:5001"`

- There is now a timout value for downloading sitemaps. You server doens't
  respond? No problem, OS2datascanner now have a default timout of 45s for all
  http-related requests. This can be changed in the `engine`s toml
  configuration. See `src/os2datascanner/engine2/default-settings.toml` for
  default values.

### Bugfixes

- `scanenr_info`, one of the new administration helper commands, had a memory
  issue for very large scans. This have been fixed and it is possible to get
  info about VLS (very large scans).

## Version 3.11.6, 30th September 2021

"New Double-Action Formula!"

### New in this version

- Support for prefetching messages:

  - Pipeline components can now collect future tasks from the server while they
    execute other tasks, greatly reducing protocol overhead and improving
    performance.

  - (Although message prefetching was disabled in version 3.3.1 to improve
    reliability, the background thread introduced in the previous version makes
    it possible to take advantage of this feature safely.)

- Support for directly opening file folders:

  - The report module can now give direct links to the network drive folders in
    which files with matches have been found, when the administrator has
    configured the network to allow this.

- The report module now has a management command for extracting information
  about running scans.

### General improvements

- Multiple organisational units can now be chosen from across the organisation
  when setting up an Exchange scanner job.

- Scanner status objects in the database are now automatically timestamped
  whenever they are updated.

- The underlying web frameworks now support WebSockets and ASGI, which future
  releases will use to provide live updates to the browser.

- To work around servers that do not correctly send the HTTP 405 response to an
  unsupported request method, the integrated web crawler now uses GET requests
  when checking external links.

- Less logging output is now produced by default.

### Bugfixes

- The web scanner no longer misdetects `mailto:` and `tel:` URLs as broken
  links.

- The Danish translation of the user interface now correctly and consistently
  uses the imperative form of certain verbs.

- Links to the low-level administration pages are now only shown to superusers.

- SSO users without a defined email address no longer produce errors in the
  report module's metadata handling code.

### Notes

- When a web scan based on a sitemap file is requested, OS2datascanner will now
  only visit the links given in the file and will not otherwise crawl the site.

- The target Python version for all parts of the OS2datascanner system is now
  **3.9**.

## Version 3.0.0, 20th December 2019

"Gift-Wrapped Under the Tree"

This is the first release of the 3.x release series of OS2datascanner.

New in this version:

-   A new, extensible scanner engine:
    -   Root privileges are no longer needed to mount remote network
        drives.
    -   Elements in compound documents can now be uniquely identified.
        -   Page numbers in PDF documents are tracked.

    -   Support for scanning Office 365 mail installations.
    -   Support for extracting metadata from scanned objects.
    -   New sources of scannable objects can be added to the system.
-   A new, extensible rule engine:
    -   CPR rules and regular expression rules have been separated.
    -   Logical operators (with short-circuiting) can be used to combine
        rules together.
    -   New kinds of rules can be added to the system.
-   A new scanner pipeline:
    -   Scans are now performed by a pipeline of independent stateless
        processes which communicate by message passing.
        -   All database interactions have been removed, drastically
            improving performance.
        -   Scalability built-in: extra copies of any process can be
            started to improve performance.
    -   Security:
        -   Individual pipeline processes run in restricted sandboxes
            and do not have access to most system resources.
        -   Scan results are filtered to avoid exposing sensitive
            information.
-   A new report module:
    -   The report module is now an independent component and not part
        of the administration system.
        -   Users no longer need access to the administration system to
            read reports, reducing the attack surface of the
            administration system.
    -   The interface has been modernised with a new design.
    -   Flexibility: results from the pipeline are stored in the
        database in JSON format.
        -   All results can be stored, even those not (yet) supported by
            the report module.
    -   Targeted reports: users can now be shown only those results for
        which they have responsibility.
        -   Support for associating metadata from scanned objects with
            users.
    -   Historical results are stored.

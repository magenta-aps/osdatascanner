# Data sources

OS2datascanner supports many data sources, and only a thin API layer is needed
to connect more to the system. This document gives a brief overview of them.

## Dropbox

## Exchange Web Services

OS2datascanner can connect to a Microsoft Exchange installation, either locally
or in the cloud, using the
[Exchange Web Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/client-developer/exchange-web-services/explore-the-ews-managed-api-ews-and-web-services-in-exchange)
API. (OS2datascanner uses the [`exchangelib`](https://github.com/ecederstrand/exchangelib)
package as its implementation of the API.)

### Try it out

(To the best of the project's knowledge, there exist no independent
implementations of the Exchange Web Services API, so you'll need access to a
functioning Exchange installation to follow these steps.)

Under the _Exchangescanner_ tab in the administration system, choose _Add
scannerjob_.

In the _URL_ field, provide the domain whose emails should be scanned, with or
without a leading `@` sign (for example, `@company.example`).

In the _Service endpoint_ field, provide the URL to the Exchange Web Services
API instance. If you don't fill it in, then the EWS autodiscovery protocol will
be used instead.

EWS doesn't offer any way of discovering the users present in an Exchange
installation, so you'll need to get that from Active Directory or from Azure
AD. Choose the _Organisatoriske enheder_ field to use OS2datascanner's LDAP
support to automatically scan all of the users detected in your organisational
hierarchy, or upload a UTF-8 text file with one account name on each line with
_Upload fil_.

#### Authenticate with a service account

For on-premises Exchange installations, you'll need to create a service
account with the special role `ApplicationImpersonation`. Having this role lets
a service account act on behalf of any other user in the same management scope.
(Naturally, OSdatascanner only uses this to read messages.) Fill in the
details of this account in the _Brugernavn_ og _Adgangskode_ fields.

(Note that _Brugernavn_ should typically resemble an email address -- that is,
`service-account@company.example`, not `service-account`.)

#### Authenticate with a Microsoft Graph client

The use of service accounts is not supported in Office 365, where you'll
instead need to set up an Azure application. (Follow the instructions in the
Azure Setup Guide to set up the basic application.)

To give the application access to EWS, select _Office 365 Exchange Online_ from
the _APIs my organization uses_ tab...

![Select "Office 365 Exchange Online"...](azure-ews-1.png)

... and then grant the application permission `full_access_as_app`.

![... and then grant the application permission "full_access_as_app".](azure-ews-2.png)

Once you've done that, you can visit the special URL `/grants/msgraph/request/`
to begin the authentication flow to make OSdatascanner aware of your Azure
tenant.

[comment]: # (## Filesystem scans)

## Google Workspace

OS2datascanner has initial support for scanning organisational Gmail and Google
Drive accounts. Google Workspace does not support the OAuth2 client credentials
flow used by the Microsoft Graph sources, so the use of these data sources
requires a lot of manual configuration.

## HTTP

OS2datascanner can scan web sites in two ways:

* as a traditional crawler, that traverses all of the links and references
  found in a web site and scans these recursively; or

* as a simple linear scan of all of the resources enumerated in a [sitemap XML
  file](https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html) (either one present on the site
  or one uploaded to the administration system).

As a policy decision, OS2datascanner does not honour the `robots.txt` file, so
you should normally only run it on sites under your control.

Note that OS2datascanner's user agent advertises both its own version and that
of the underlying `python-requests` library:

    OS2datascanner 3.17.7 (python-requests/2.28.1) (+https://os2datascanner.dk/agent)

Be aware of this if you need to whitelist the user agent; in particular, make
sure that a blacklist rule for `python-requests` doesn't take priority.

### Notes on the crawler

The crawler implements a simple depth-first search of a website. Given a
website with the following links:

| `index.html` | `a.html` | `b.html` |
| ------------ | -------- | -------- |
| `a.html`<br>`b.html`<br>`c.html` | `a1.html`<br>`a2.png` | `b1.html`<br>`b2.jpg`<br>`b3.html` |

... a crawl starting at `index.html` would emit links in the following order:

* `index.html`;
* the links from `index.html`: `a.html`, `b.html` and `c.html`;
* the links from `a.html`: `a1.html` and `a2.png`;
* the links from `b.html`: `b1.html`, `b2.jpg` and `b3.html`;
* the links from `a1.html`, if there were any;
* etc.

Only links of the form `<a href="" />` (where `rel="nofollow"` is not set) and
`<img src="" />` are treated as candidates for crawling. To avoid infinite
recursion, links are only crawled to a certain depth, configurable for each
installation.

Links are only crawled when they're to a "similar enough" domain. Links to
other domains will be emitted, to enable dead link detection, but not otherwise
explored or processed by the rest of the pipeline. The precise definition of
"similar enough" may vary between releases, but as of version 3.18.7 a scan of
`example.com` would be permitted to explore links under all of the following
domains:

* `www.example.com`
* `www2.example.com`
* `m.example.com`
* `ww1.example.com`
* `ww2.example.com`
* `en.example.com`
* `da.example.com`
* `secure.example.com`

Upgrading the security of a connection is treated as "similar enough", but
downgrading it is not. (A scan of `http://example.com/` is allowed to explore
links under `https://example.com/`, but not vice-versa.)

If the crawler is configured to search a prefix, then links belonging to the
domain but _not_ under that prefix will not be emitted at all. That is, while
scanning `https://example.com/subtree/`, no link to
`https://example.com/index.html` would be emitted, even if one was found.

### Notes on sitemaps

When using a sitemap, OS2datascanner will emit the specified root page and the
files enumerated in the sitemap, _and nothing else_. Crawling is disabled when
using a sitemap, which can provide better performance.

Starting with release 3.22.2, OS2datascanner also supports
[Google's image extensions](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/image-sitemaps) to the sitemap schema. Earlier releases
do not support the extensions: only those links present in a `<loc />` tag are
emitted.

OS2datascanner trusts the hints provided by a sitemap over the information
provided by HTTP headers: if the `<lastmod />` element contains a last
modification date for a URL, then its `Last-Modified` header value won't even
be fetched. (This header is often overridden by a proxy server or web cache, so
its value can be less reliable.)

OS2datascanner also implements a sitemap extension, the `<hints />` element,
that can be used to give the same behaviour for the `Content-Type` header:

```xml
    <url>
        <loc>
            https://www.example.com/resources/2023/STD-2023-0001.PDF
        </loc>
        <lastmod>
            2023-01-19
        </lastmod>
        <hints xmlns="https://ns.magenta.dk/schemas/sitemap-hints/0.1"
                content-type="application/pdf" />
    </url>
```

Using these two elements properly can greatly reduce the number of HTTP
requests OS2datascanner must make.

Note that hints are only valid for the scan in which they were found: if
OS2datascanner finds a match in a file whose MIME type was specified by the
sitemap, then subsequent checkups for that file _will_ retrieve the
`Content-Type` header.

### Try it out

The development environment includes a web server with a few conspicuous files.
Under the _Webscanner tab in the administration system, choose _Add
scannerjob_, and specify the URL `http://nginx/`.

The web server can be scanned both with a sitemap (`http://nginx/sitemap.xml`)
and without.

## Microsoft Graph

OS2datascanner has support for scanning resources present in Microsoft Graph,
and can participate in the normal OAuth2 client credentials flow to allow
administrators to revocably delegate permissions to an OS2datascanner instance.
Microsoft Graph can also be used as a source of organisational information.

Office 365 mails, OneDrive and SharePoint files, and calendar invitations are
the only resources presently supported. ([Microsoft restricts API access to
Microsoft Teams](https://learn.microsoft.com/da-dk/graph/teams-protected-apis),
so this feature remains under internal test.)

### Try it out

Log in to your Microsoft Graph tenant as a global administrator. Under the
_App registrations_ blade, choose _New registration_.

Choose a name for the application (_OS2datascanner dev test_, for example),
specify that it's a single tenant app, and give
`http://localhost:8040/grants/msgraph/receive/` as a redirect URL (of type
_Web_).

Under the resulting _Overview_ blade, copy the application ID and provide it to
the OS2datascanner administration system as the setting `MSGRAPH_APP_ID`. Then
open the _Certificates & secrets_ blade and create a new client secret. Copy
its value and provide it to the administration system as the setting
`MSGRAPH_CLIENT_SECRET`.

Open the _API permissions_ blade and give the application the following
_application permissions_:

* `Calendars.Read`
* `Directory.Read.All`
* `Files.Read.All`
* `Mail.Read`
* `Sites.Read.All`

(Because OS2datascanner doesn't operate in the context of a specific user, but
rather of the organisation as a whole, these must be application permissions
rather than delegated ones.)

Once you've done that, return to your OS2datascanner instance and choose one
of the _Office 365_ scanner types. The first time you set one of these up,
you'll be redirected to Microsoft and asked to confirm that you want your
OS2datascanner instance to have access to your tenant; after this has been done
once, OS2datascanner will remember the delegation and reuse it for future
scanner jobs.

## SMB

Using the `libsmbclient` and `pysmbc` packages, OS2datascanner can scan SMB
servers, better known as Windows network drives. These packages also give
OS2datascanner the ability to perform ad hoc authentication using normal
Windows login credentials, so there's no need to permanently enroll the scanner
engine's server into the Windows domain.

(OS2datascanner can also use the SMB support built into the operating system
kernel, but this is deprecated, as it requires that certain scanner components
be given higher privilege levels.)

### Try it out

The development environment includes a Samba server which you can use to test
SMB scans. Under the _Filescanner_ tab in the administration system, choose
_Add scannerjob_.

The _URL_ field is used to specify the UNC path to the network drive you'd like
to scan. UNC paths are of the form `//server-name/path/to/folder` (with either
forward or backward slashes). Fill in `//samba/e2test` here.

(If your Windows environment maps the given UNC path to a drive letter, you can
optionally provide that in the _Drevbogstav_ field. This is only used for
display purposes.)

Under the _Brugeroplysninger_ section, leave the _Brugerdomæne_ field empty,
and specify the username `os2` and the password `swordfish`.
